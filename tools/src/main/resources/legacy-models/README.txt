This collection of .dmr files for use as the basis for model comparisons was started during the JBoss AS 7.x days. Later
we started adding .dmr files for EAP releases.

Now we are at EAP 7.0.0, which is close to overlapping with the original JBoss AS 7.x.x.dmr file names. At some stage we
should split these into eap/ and wf/ sub-folders.

For now I am relying on a lucky outcome in that AS/WF releases have a .Final suffix (e.g. -8.1.0.Final.dmr), while the
EAP ones do not so they are simply e.g. -6.4.0.dmr. This is the current convention.
